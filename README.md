# SwiftTime

A Swift pomodoro incorporating Facebook POP animations. Currently, the user is able to open the app and immediately start a Pomodoro session, working for 25 minutes focused and then take a 5 minute break. Sound effects can toggle on/off, and focus and break times can be edited. At the completion of each focus session, the user is prompted to write about what they did. These tasks can be referenced later. 

## Special Note

As this project uses the POP framework, it will throw nasty errors at you if you open the normal Xcode file. Once you get the repo, open the .xcworkspace file to properly run on your own machine.
